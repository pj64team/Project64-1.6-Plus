# Project64 1.6 Plus

Project64 1.6 Plus is a free and source-available emulator for the Nintendo 64 and It is written in C/C++ currently only for Windows. What does source-available mean? It means if anyone would like to contribute to the project they are welcome to but need to create a PR showing all changes without any releases before the PR is viewed and agreed on! What does it not allow? It does not allow forking of the project and changing without asking permission beforehand (Create a PR and wait for a response) It does not allow forking of the project, downloading and changing offline and creating releases without express permnission before handf via a PR that shows all changes) This project is a feature & vulnerability update fix of the original Project 64 1.6 source and is not an open source project what so ever!. It is targeted at the communities that still desire to use 1.6's ability to play Rom Hacks and a-like because of an incorect core that lets a lot of things slide when it comes to compatibility. 

This is not intended for development use or is it a modernised 1.6 core, it is just a "Safety Fix" For its loyal users and some added features that they may enjoy.

## Enhancements special mentions (amongst many)

- Arbitrary code vulnerability fix.

    TLB miss in write opcodes are now generating exceptions as expected. This solves a vulnerability that can allow roms
    to run arbitrary code in previous releases.  
	
- TLB: extra checks for overflow buffer mapping for user TLB entries

	Adds an extra check for user mapping TLB further than allowed buffer size.

- Retain 1.6 original ROM Hack compatibility

- Advance Mode enabled by default (allowing to name a few)

  - File/Rom Information
  - System/Screenshot Capture
  - Optiuons/Configure RSP Plugin
  - Help/About INIFiles 

- Save/load states (10 extra than original release)
- Game Information in File & Rom Browser (Popup Menu)
- Good Name replaced by Game Name in RDB & Browser Tab.
- Internal Name replaced by File Name in Title Bar when emulating.
- New Entry uses File name not Internal Name to add to Game Name in RDB
- Rom Browser uses File name to display a game not currently in RDB with the status of unknown,
  but once added to the RDB it will use the Game Name= instead.
- Always remember cheats as default so user don't have to re-enable after every close
- Max 10 Recent Roms as default
- Max 10 Recent Rom Dir as default
- Rom Dir Recursion as default, this allows sub-directories to be included in rom browser
- Jabo specific pemrcheats read from the jabo.ini so they do not effect other plugins as no longer enabled in the rdb.
- Display build date and time in About dialog title bar for easy build version recognition
